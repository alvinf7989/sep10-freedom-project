Tool: **CSS Variables**

---

2/28/24:
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) Tinkered with the first example of variables by changing the white element to black. But I can do better. I added a little code snipet on my W3Schools directory called varexample1.md. On the website the preview used to have a white background, but I edited it to have a black background.

Here's what the code snippet used to look like:
```
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

body { background-color: var(--blue); }

h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue); }

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--white);
  color: var(--blue);
  border: 1px solid var(--blue);
  padding: 5px;
}
```
What I changed was the background colors for the `.container` and `button` class, which eres white at first, but I changed it to black.

* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-css-variables-and-how-to-use-them/) I also tinkered with the first example of FreeCodeCamp's CSS variable example. This was the CSS code in the beginning:

```
:root {
  --main-bg-color: #000080;
  --main-text-color: #fff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
  color: var(--main-text-color);
  text-align: center;
}
```
So, what I did was change the `main-background` and `text-color` from blue & white to cyan & green.
