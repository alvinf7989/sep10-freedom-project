# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Alvin Frias**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing which is Culinary Arts.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Culinary Arts**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Culinary Arts** in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* **Fry-O-Clock**
    * The timer makes a noise
    * Easy Time management
    * There's rarely any other deep fryer that can do this.
    * Makes this easy for those that can't remember when it's done frying.
    * Beneficial in cooking
* **Freeze-O-Clock**
    * An AI voice will tell you when item is done freezing.
    * Easy time management
    * Easy to freeze Jelly & Ice Cream
    * Frozen solid is good for making ice cubes.
* **Auto-Spinning Whisk**
    * No more wrist cramps.
    * Perfect for making egg whites
* **Mini Oven 2.0**
    * Beneficial in cooking or baking more than 1 or 2 items in the oven.
    * Works with other types of trays
##### CONS
* **Fry-O-Clock**
    * This isn't a wireless device.
    * When plugged in, it could use a large amount of electricity to fry something.
    * There's only a deep fryer version.
    * The noise the timer makes when done frying can be irritating.
* **Freeze-O-Clock**
    * There's 3 slots for these modes, but they only show the pictures of which slot is which, which can be very confusing.
    * When plugged, it might take a large amount of energy depending on how many things you're freezing.
    * Uses AI which may or may not be controversial.
* **Auto-Spinning Whisk**
    * While there are two AA batteries for this two work it's the only way for the whisk to wirelessly work.
    * If changed at a higher speed of the whisk it might use more electricity when used. (That is if you plug it)
    * Loses the effort of people using more arm movement.
* **Mini Oven 2.0**
    * Only certain trays could fit.
    * Could take up space.
    * Average size could make title misleading.
