# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Alvin Frias**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing which is Culinary Arts.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Culinary Arts**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Culinary Arts** in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* **Fry-O-Clock**
    * The timer makes a noise
    *
    * There's rarely any other deep fryer that can do this.
    * Makes this easy for those that can't remember when it's done frying
##### CONS
* **Fry-O-Clock**
    * This isn't a wireless device.
    * When plugged in, it could use a large amount of electricity to fry something.
    * There's only a deep fryer version.
    * The noise the timer makes when done frying can be irritating.
