## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Welcome to my Freedom Project. Here I will show you all the part A inventions that I found from both Software and Hardware of my topic Culinary Arts. As well as the Part B inventions I’ve been thinking about.
* These inventions that I’ve thought about include the O-clock devices. We are going to start with Software and here are my notes and links from my Google Searches.

## Part A: existing technology

  * So, if you click the link that’s above, it will take you to a reliable source called EHL Insights. It’s where I learned about Culinary Arts.
  * You can see the image about [EHL Insights here](https://info.ehl.edu/hubfs/Hospitality_Insights_EHL_Master_In_Global-Hospitality_Business_Header_001.jpg).
  * EHL Insights can be used from any device that includes MacOS, Windows, & more.
  * The site overall is really easy to navigate. It’s very organized.
  * Did I also mention that this site has little to no ad pop-ups?
