Topic: Culinary Arts

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Welcome to my Freedom Project. Here I will show you all the part A inventions that I found from both Software and Hardware of my topic Culinary Arts. As well as the Part B inventions I’ve been thinking about.
* These inventions that I’ve thought about include the O-clock devices. We are going to start with Software and here are my notes and links from my Google Searches.

## Part A: existing technology
* EHL Insights (What Is Culinary Arts)
  * This is a link to the first site about Culinary Arts. [What Is Culinary Arts?](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts#:~:text=So%2C%20put%20simply%2C%20culinary%20arts,professions%20that%20involve%20food%20service)
  * So, if you click the link that’s above, it will take you to a reliable source called EHL Insights. It’s where I learned about Culinary Arts.
  * You can see the image about [EHL Insights here](https://info.ehl.edu/hubfs/Hospitality_Insights_EHL_Master_In_Global-Hospitality_Business_Header_001.jpg). Or see the image to the right.
  * EHL Insights can be used from any device that includes MacOS, Windows, & more.
  * The site overall is really easy to navigate. It’s very organized.
  * Did I also mention that this site has little to no ad pop-ups?

* This is the second link about Culinary Arts [What Are The Culinary Arts?](https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/culinary-arts/what-are-the-culinary-arts/)
  * So, this link is from a school called Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts. It’s basically a school to practice cooking
  * This was the next link that I put on my second blog entry which can be seen here. Or here. (https://github.com/alvinf7989/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry02.md)
  * Here’s an image link [Find Your Mentor in Cooking Business](https://www.escoffier.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Escoffier-Mentor-1080-%C3%97-1080-px.png).
  * This is also a reliable source because of a website called [Niche.com](https://www.niche.com/colleges/escoffier-school-of-culinary-arts-boulder/#:~:text=The%20chef%20instructors%20do%20their,my%20decision%20to%20attend%20Escoffier!&text=Being%20a%20student%20at%20the,has%20been%20wonderful%20thus%20far). It’s an app where you can post reviews about places.
  * The reviews however are mostly about the school that this website is created from, but they are mostly five or four stars.
  * This link about Culinary Arts runs on just the same amount of hardware as the previous link, except this website is from a school.
  * This site, just like the previous one, has no ad pop-ups.

Now that we are done with Software, that doesn’t mean we are done with the rest of Culinary Arts because next up is Hardware.

* [Best Kitchen Tablets](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/the-best-tablets-for-the-kitchen-article)
  * This web app/site talks about the best tablets that can be used for the kitchen.
  * According to the website, the Apple iPad is the best kitchen tablet overall.
  * Here’s an image link from the [website](https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/6164955a4ec4c7291c4d1076/16:9/w_2240,c_limit/BestTablets_INSET_V1_120519_13636_V3_final.jpg)
  * This site has no typos, making this website more reliable than it should.

* [Culinary Hill](https://www.culinaryhill.com/cool-kitchen-gadgets/)
 * So, when I google things such as Culinary Arts, I was going to go through the first page of Google and then I found a website called Culinary Hill.
 * The first electronic kitchen gadget I see is a Battery-Operated Milk Frother made by MasterChef.
 * This website talks about 49 Cool Kitchen Gadgets, but I was looking for electronic gadgets, so that’s why I looked through these 49 kitchen gadgets & found some that are electronic.
 * Here’s an image for that
 * Has the same reliability as Epicurious.com with no typos or little to no ads.
 * Most of the Kitchen gadgets I could find on this website are powered by batteries or by plugs.


## Part B: possible future technology

Now that we are done with both Software and Hardware of Culinary Arts, we move on to the Internet of Things (IoT) of Culinary Arts.
