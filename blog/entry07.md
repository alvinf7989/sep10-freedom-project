# Entry 7
##### 5/30/2024

## Content
Alright, this is the final FINAL entry. I was told this by my SEP teacher. Now this isn't like Entry 5 where it's the fake last entry, this is the actual last one becasue here I will show my Presentation and expo experiences on the content section. Let's start with Presentations since I did that first.

### Presentation
So to plan my presentation I created a total of 7 slides as long as you don't include the title of the slides.

* **1st Slide:** I said I would define art in a way that I also relate this with hobbies and that's when I relate it with my topic: Cooking.

## Skills

Now let's get a recap of all the skills that I have acquired

### How To Google
This was my first skill that I acquired on the very first entry. For Part A we were looking for Software products of Cooking and all I could find were web apps. I made two Google Searches and sometimes I didn't go on the first website that popped up. I also learned a few things fromn these searches and resources like how Baking & Pastry Arts is different from Culinary Arts and that it refers to preparing, cooking, or presenting & plating the food service.

### Organization
Organization was my second skill that I put on my second entry and I used organization via bullet points. Bullet points can help me separate my ideas just like the `<hr>` tag. I used this for Parts A & B and these were how I organized these ideas and features.

#### Part A
* <-- This bullet point represents the name of the Google Search
  * <-- This indented bullet point represents the link to the website found from Google Search.
    * <-- This other indented bullet point represents the descriptions for the websites.

#### Part B
* <-- This bullet point represents the invention name
  * <-- This indented bullet point represents the description about the invention.
    * <-- This other indented bullet point represents the ideas for the invention.
      * <-- The second squared bullet point which represents more ideas for the other ideas.

As you can see, I used a lot of indentation with my bullet points. I was also told that I shouldn't include the names of the Google Searches for my Freedom Project as that is "behind-the-scenes".

### Creativity
This was a skill that I put in entry 3 back when I was in Part B of the Freedom Project. In this part, we had to imagine a few products for the future that are related to our topic. And with my creativity, I imagined four devices, two of which have similar names. These products are:

* The auto spinning whisk
  * This is a whisk that spins by itself and has the following features:
    * Can be rechargeable with Type C Charging
    * Or can use two AA batteries
    * Can adjust the speeds 1 to 5 on the whisk
* Fry-o-clock
  * A deep fryer that tells you when the food in the fryer is done cooking.
    * Perfect for those that can’t remember the time
    * Can change the temperature.
    * Active when plugged in
* Mini Oven 2.0
  * A miniature oven like no other with some more features.
    * Can change the temperature of how high the heat should be.
    * Can handle 4 big trays or 8 smaller trays.
    * Bigger than a normal miniature oven, but smaller than a big oven.
    * Works as long as it’s plugged.
    * Works with cupcake trays and others
    * Fast heating feature which is allowed to be usable every 6 hours.
    * Removable tray display
* Freeze-o-clock
  * A mini Freezer that tells you when an item is done freezing
    * Can set the timer or have the following modes
      * Jelly which has the timer set to how long it takes for the jelly to be frozen
      * Frozen Solid which sets the timer to how long for an item to be frozen solid.
      * Ice cream which sets the timer to whenever the ice cream is ready to eat.
    * Has all these features usable at the same time.
    * Also with representation
      * If it’s red, the item isn’t frozen
      * If it’s blue, the item is frozen
      * If it’s blue but it shows a frozen ice block, the item is too frozen
    * Active when plugged in.
    * Adjust the coldness of the freezer.
    * An AI that speaks to you in correlation to the freezer.
    * Can tell you when items are frozen.

But I didn't just think of these features on my own. No, I actually showed my ideas on Slack and some people gave me more ideas to my future products of the Freedom Project. By the way when I said two products had similar names, I meant the Freeze-o-clock and Fry-o-clock.

### Debugging
This skill was the one that I "apparently" put in entry 4, despite not completing the learning log yet. I was able to tinker in more than just the W3Schools website. That's right I was able to practice in FreeCodeCamp and the other sources which were YouTube & MDN Web Docs. Ever since I had my learning log, I have increased my intelligence in my tool, which is "CSS Variables". From just changing one variable value to learning fallback values, this has really upgraded my skill of debugging.

### How To Learn
I used a thing called "LOYO" which meant "Learn In Your Own" and that process was very useful during my learning log. I believe the one file it was _most_ useful for was the YouTube file because I couldn't copy and paste any code there and I had to follow what the video had shown.

### Problem Decomposition
Problem Decomposition was a new skil that I acquired because as I was making my Freedom project website, I had a few days to create the divs of each Part, so in a way, it's like breaking my task of creating a whole website into a few smaller tasks for these days of my Spring Break.
