# Entry 7
##### 5/30/2024

## Content
Alright, this is the final FINAL entry. I was told this by my SEP teacher. Now this isn't like Entry 5 where it's the fake last entry, this is the actual last one becasue here I will show my Presentation and expo experiences on the content section. Let's start with Presentations since I did that first.

### Presentation
So to plan my presentation I created a total of 7 slides as long as you don't include the title of the slides.

* **1st Slide:** I said I would define art in a way that I also relate this with hobbies and that's when I relate it with my topic: Cooking. So what I did was put a bunch of images that represent creatvie activities that define the term arts using the animation features on the slides.

* **2nd Slide:** I just show a picture of the first part of my website and then make it a clickable link and it also says "My Freedom Project" at the bottom of the slide.

* **3rd Slide:** I show off my Mobile wireframe that I made in a wireframe link in the use of images. Since, the image was too long I had to split the wireframe into three parts.

* **4th Slide:** This is just like the 3rd slide when I showed off three parts of my wireframe because again, it was too long. The difference is that this was a Desktop wireframe. So far these wireframes closely match to what I ended up with in my Freedom Project.

* **5th Slide:** For the 5th slide, I showed off my tool CSS Variables by showing the `root` class values and to make things simpler for people to understand what the values are, I put in the color names that the hex codes represent. Here's the code snippet for that `root:`
```
:root {
    --header-text: #fff;
    --border-color: #6be57f;
    --header-img: url(img/culinary-image.jpeg);
    --bg-colour: #11427a;
    --bland-border: black;
    --part-b: #cf30c0;
    --grad-clr-1: #93e6f1;
}
```
 I also put in the image of the bootstrap template I downloaded.

* **6th Slide:** This slide was where I put my challenges of making the website responsive. I put in two images: The `.head-image` class and the image on the top of the Freedom Project. Code snippet below:
```
.head-image {
    background-image: var(--header-img);
    /* width: 2033px; */
    height: 300px;
    background-size: cover;
    background-color: var(--bg-colour);
    background-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```
I put these two together to represent how hard it was to make that part of the website responsive when resizing.

* **7th Slide:** For the conclusion slide, I put in the link to my Freedom Project and the takeaways I put included a picture of all the `col` classes that make certains columns stack on each other during certain widths. My other takeaway was using the `img-fluid` class which sets the image at `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`, so I put in what the `img-fluid` class does for that final slide. Speaking of putting links to the [Freedom Project](https://alvinf7989.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)

<hr> And that sums up the presentation slides. If you want to see these slides yourself, the link is right [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12fJFXskisvxXeR-5bHr394zNwyIbpg7muUzfS_JpAzc/edit#slide=id.g2ddb72c5a47_0_58)

### Expo
This expo was located in the cafeteria on the fifth and final floor of the Hstat school building and it took 2 periods. What we did was show off our websites/Freedom Projects to viewers and judges and we'll see what the judges choose to be presented at the showcase in the auditorium. Now before the Elevator Expo Pitch, I was assigned to write my plans as to what to say to the judges in our notes which you can see mines on the Freedom Project [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WYOzoE-4xzKLydsesYDgUok3gVt1oPEcbfyBx0qhDxE/edit#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9) Here's what I had on my notes:

* Ask the judges or people if they like cooking
* Say that these are web apps for Part A:software
* Showcase the Part A: Hardware that already exists
* Introduce the Part B
* Say that two of these Part B devices are similar
* Say that I got more ideas for the devices of Part B from Slack
* End with a thank you

Now I've followed the plan perfectly when the Expo day started, but I also added on and said that I was proud of one of these four inventions because of the amount of ideas it had. I'm talking about the Freeze-O-Clock. Just because presentations have to end with a thank you doesn't mean that the Expos don't. I think it's important to greet and thank the audience for seeing the project and presentation.

**EDP**

After improving my Freedom Project and going beyond MVP. I'm now at the final part of the EDP which is Communicating the results. I knew I was at this process because I was talking to the audience and the judges at the expo about my project in the cafeteria.

## Skills

Now let's get a recap of all the skills that I have acquired

### How To Google
This was my first skill that I acquired on the very first entry. For Part A we were looking for Software products of Cooking and all I could find were web apps. I made two Google Searches and sometimes I didn't go on the first website that popped up. I also learned a few things fromn these searches and resources like how Baking & Pastry Arts is different from Culinary Arts and that it refers to preparing, cooking, or presenting & plating the food service.

### Organization
Organization was my second skill that I put on my second entry and I used organization via bullet points. Bullet points can help me separate my ideas just like the `<hr>` tag. I used this for Parts A & B and these were how I organized these ideas and features.

#### Part A
* <-- This bullet point represents the name of the Google Search
  * <-- This indented bullet point represents the link to the website found from Google Search.
    * <-- This other indented bullet point represents the descriptions for the websites.

#### Part B
* <-- This bullet point represents the invention name
  * <-- This indented bullet point represents the description about the invention.
    * <-- This other indented bullet point represents the ideas for the invention.
      * <-- The second squared bullet point which represents more ideas for the other ideas.

As you can see, I used a lot of indentation with my bullet points. I was also told that I shouldn't include the names of the Google Searches for my Freedom Project as that is "behind-the-scenes". This wasn't the only time I used Organization because I also used bullet points for my Presentation & Expo plan as well as the last days of learning my CSS Tool.

### Creativity
This was a skill that I put in entry 3 back when I was in Part B of the Freedom Project. In this part, we had to imagine a few products for the future that are related to our topic. And with my creativity, I imagined four devices, two of which have similar names. These products are:

* The auto spinning whisk
  * This is a whisk that spins by itself and has the following features:
    * Can be rechargeable with Type C Charging
    * Or can use two AA batteries
    * Can adjust the speeds 1 to 5 on the whisk
* Fry-o-clock
  * A deep fryer that tells you when the food in the fryer is done cooking.
    * Perfect for those that can’t remember the time
    * Can change the temperature.
    * Active when plugged in
* Mini Oven 2.0
  * A miniature oven like no other with some more features.
    * Can change the temperature of how high the heat should be.
    * Can handle 4 big trays or 8 smaller trays.
    * Bigger than a normal miniature oven, but smaller than a big oven.
    * Works as long as it’s plugged.
    * Works with cupcake trays and others
    * Fast heating feature which is allowed to be usable every 6 hours.
    * Removable tray display
* Freeze-o-clock
  * A mini Freezer that tells you when an item is done freezing
    * Can set the timer or have the following modes
      * Jelly which has the timer set to how long it takes for the jelly to be frozen
      * Frozen Solid which sets the timer to how long for an item to be frozen solid.
      * Ice cream which sets the timer to whenever the ice cream is ready to eat.
    * Has all these features usable at the same time.
    * Also with representation
      * If it’s red, the item isn’t frozen
      * If it’s blue, the item is frozen
      * If it’s blue but it shows a frozen ice block, the item is too frozen
    * Active when plugged in.
    * Adjust the coldness of the freezer.
    * An AI that speaks to you in correlation to the freezer.
    * Can tell you when items are frozen.

But I didn't just think of these features on my own. No, I actually showed my ideas on Slack and some people gave me more ideas to my future products of the Freedom Project. By the way when I said two products had similar names, I meant the Freeze-o-clock and Fry-o-clock.

### Debugging
This skill was the one that I "apparently" put in entry 4, despite not completing the learning log yet. I was able to tinker in more than just the W3Schools website. That's right I was able to practice in FreeCodeCamp and the other sources which were YouTube & MDN Web Docs. Ever since I had my learning log, I have increased my intelligence in my tool, which is "CSS Variables". From just changing one variable value to learning fallback values, this has really upgraded my skill of debugging.

### How To Learn
I used a thing called "LOYO" which meant "Learn In Your Own" and that process was very useful during my learning log. I believe the one file it was _most_ useful for was the YouTube file because I couldn't copy and paste any code there and I had to follow what the video had shown.

### Problem Decomposition
Problem Decomposition was a new skil that I acquired because as I was making my Freedom project website, I had a few days to create the divs of each Part, so in a way, it's like breaking my task of creating a whole website into a few smaller tasks for these days of my Spring Break. <hr> Now these were all skills I've had in this past, but now there's time for one new skill:

### Communication
Ever since the expo and presentations had begun, I have acquired the skill of talking to the audience during these events. I even learned to say what's not on the slides and on the Freedom Project. I also stated back in my 5th entry that I kinda used this when sharing out my Part B ideas on Slack and that the people that gave feedback helped me improve these ideas.

<hr> Well, look at how far we've gone. From just picking a topic to presenting a whole website to the judges. This truly is a 12-month journey to never forget. The only question I have is- Wait, what's that? I forgot to talk about professianalism? Oh right, I fixed up all of my typos and in fact this professionalism is used in my skills such as Attention to detail which was a skill I basically used more throughout this whole freedom project. Now back to the only question I had: There's still a few days left of class for SEP, I wonder what we'll do on those last few days after finishing the whole Freedom Project Process. Anyways, this is the actual final entry and I'll say a few things from the 5th entry. Working on this Freedom Project couldn't be possible without these 7 blog entries. Now, the next task is to finsih the Blog overviewSo, I must say again this
