## Content
Welcome back to another blog entry where today, I talk about the Freedom Project. So, I am done with part A, so that means we're moving on to Part B of the Freedom Project. So, what we had to do for Part B was Brainstorm ideas for the inventions in the future. Last time, in Part A we listed inventions that already exist now. Now we're brainstorming inventions for the future. Since my topic was Culinary Arts I called my list of future inventions...

### The Future of Culinary Inventions
First, up I organized all my inventions with bullet points.
* <-- This bullet point represents the invention name
  * <-- This indented bullet point represents the description about the invention.
    * <-- This other indented bullet point represents the ideas for the invention.
      * <-- The second squared bullet point which represents more ideas for the other ideas.

* The auto spinning whisk
  * This is a whisk that spins by itself and has the following features:
    * Can be rechargeable with Type C Charging
    * Or can use two AA batteries
    * Can adjust the speeds 1 to 5 on the whisk
* Fry-o-clock
  * A deep fryer that tells you when the food in the fryer is done cooking.
    * Perfect for those that can’t remember the time
    * Can change the temperature.
    * Active when plugged in
* Mini Oven 2.0
  * A miniature oven like no other with some more features.
    * Can change the temperature of how high the heat should be.
    * Can handle 4 big trays or 8 smaller trays.
    * Bigger than a normal miniature oven, but smaller than a big oven.
    * Works as long as it’s plugged.
    * Works with cupcake trays and others
    * Fast heating feature which is allowed to be usable every 6 hours.
    * Removable tray display
* Freeze-o-clock
  * A mini Freezer that tells you when an item is done freezing
    * Can set the timer or have the following modes
      * Jelly which has the timer set to how long it takes for the jelly to be frozen
      * Frozen Solid which sets the timer to how long for an item to be frozen solid.
      * Ice cream which sets the timer to whenever the ice cream is ready to eat.
    * Has all these features usable at the same time.
    * Also with representation
      * If it’s red, the item isn’t frozen
      * If it’s blue, the item is frozen
      * If it’s blue but it shows a frozen ice block, the item is too frozen
    * Active when plugged in.
    * Adjust the coldness of the freezer.
    * An AI that speaks to you in correlation to the freezer.
    * Can tell you when items are frozen.

As you can see there are two inventions that have similar names. That is because I imagined an "o-clock" company making those inventions. Right now, I'm only imagining the "Fry-o-clock" and the "Freeze-o-clock" making it as future inventions. I finalized this from my Freedom Project Content by adding transitioning text from Part A to Part B.
