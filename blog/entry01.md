## My 1st Topic

My 1st topic for this blog entry is going to be Culinary Arts. I was going to choose Computer Engineering, but then realized that my topics have to be connected with Tech and not be Technology itself. Here's my top 3 topics

1. Computer Engineering
2. Culinary Arts
3. Music Production

## Engineering Design Process
I was on the 1st stage, which is defining the true arts of cooking. So, when I was looking up Culninary Arts on Google, one of the websites that popped up was [What Is Culinary Arts?](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts) and basicaly it told me that Culinary Arts is referable to preparing and cooking the food. According to studies in the site, it's responsible to make sure that all of the senses have a satisfaction with the edible products. I have decided to use Google, and [What Is Culinary Arts?](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts) and more resources about Culinary Arts.
