## My 1st Topic

* My 1st topic for this blog entry is going to be Culinary Arts. I was going to choose Computer Engineering, but then realized that my topics have to be connected with Tech and not be Technology itself. Here's my 3 topics

* Computer Engineering
* Culinary Arts
* Music Production

## Engineering Design Process
* I was on the 1st stage, which is defining the true arts of cooking. So, when I was looking up Culninary Arts on Google, one of the websites that popped up was [What Is Culinary Arts?](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts) and basicaly it told me that Culinary Arts is referable to preparing and cooking the food. According to studies in the site, it's responsible to make sure that all of the senses have a satisfaction with the edible products. I have decided to use Google, and [What Is Culinary Arts?](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts) and more resources about Culinary Arts. 

## Skills
* One skill that I learned from this blog was **How To Google** I will later update this blog when I have more skills that I learned.       

**How To Google**
* So, what I did was look up Culinary Arts on Google; you probably know that from the engineering design process. I just looked at the first website about Culinary Arts and got some pretty neat information. For example, I learned that Baking & Pastry Arts is different from Culinary Arts and that it refers to preparing, cooking, or presenting & plating the food service.

## Conclusion
* In conclusion, I really like the sound of cooking or Culinary Arts as a fancy term. And I can't wait for the opportunity where I will someday be able to cook things myself. I can't wait to start this website about Culinary Arts. If only I could join a Culinary School and it was possible to do stuff both in Collenge and in Culinary School.
