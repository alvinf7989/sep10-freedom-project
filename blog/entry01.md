# SEP 10 Entry 1
## My 1st Topic
So my first topic is going to be Culinary Arts. I was going to choose Computer Engineering, but then realized that I have to pick a topic that has a connection with tech, meaning I can't choose tech related topics for my entry. Here's the top 3 that I had.

1. Computer Engineering
2. Culinary Arts
3. Music Production
  
So, when I searched up "Culinary Arts" on Google, the first website that popped up was [What Is Culinary Arts?](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts#:~:text=So%2C%20put%20simply%2C%20culinary%20arts,professions%20that%20involve%20food%20service.) and it told me that Culinary Arts are referrable to preparing and cooking the food.
