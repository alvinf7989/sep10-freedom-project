## Content   
There was many info that I found about software and hardware for my topic which was "Culinary Arts" and I have put them all into my notes. So what I found first was the software part of Culinary Arts. What I did was google my searches for Culinary Arts. (We'll get to more detail on the Skills part) So what I did on my first blog entry was put in what my 1st topic was which was Culinary Arts. I also talked about what I searched from Culinary Arts about the software. These searches were:
* Culinary Arts
* What Is Culinary Arts?

We will have the info on the next parts starting with...

## Sources
Even though I put many sources on the notes, I never seemed to put them in my entry. So I'm going to put the sources in here. 

### Software
The first source when searching up Culinary Arts was [What Is Culinary Arts? by EHL Insights](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts#:~:text=So%2C%20put%20simply%2C%20culinary%20arts,professions%20that%20involve%20food%20service). So, this is the source where I learned about Culinary Arts like the responsibilities of all the senses to have satisfaction with what's prepared as food. I also put in my notes the software like how this source which is from another site called "EHL Insights" had no ad pop-ups, it's easy to navigate and that it can be used on any electronic device with a screen. The next search I had was "What Is Culinary Arts?", and I of course went to the first result which was, [What Are The Culinary Arts?](https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/culinary-arts/what-are-the-culinary-arts/). This is from one of those school websites which are mostly reliable. This school website was called "Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts". I also said this has the same features as the last website. This also taught me things that I had never thoguht of. Like I didn't know Baking & Pastry Arts are different from Culinary Arts.

### Hardware
On to the hardware parts of the sources. So I wrote on my notes that my former Google search was Culinary Hardware because that only showed me physical hardware, so my next search was "Digital Culinary hardware". I didn't go to the first website this time. Instead, I went to this reliable website called [Epicurious.com](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/the-best-tablets-for-the-kitchen-article). This website talked about what tablets are the best for Kitchen uses in online recipes. According to the website, Apple iPads are the best kitchen tablets overall.
