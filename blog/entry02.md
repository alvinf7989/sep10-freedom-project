## Content   
There was many info that I found about software and hardware for my topic which was "Culinary Arts" and I have put them all into my notes. So what I found first was the software part of Culinary Arts. What I did was google my searches for Culinary Arts. (We'll get to more detail on the Skills part) So what I did on my first blog entry was put in what my 1st topic was which was Culinary Arts. I also talked about what I searched from Culinary Arts about the software. These searches were:
* Culinary Arts
* What Is Culinary Arts?

We will have the info on the next parts starting with...

## Sources
Even though I put many sources on the notes, I never seemed to put them in my 1st entry. So I'm going to put the sources in here. 

### Software
The first source when searching up Culinary Arts was [What Is Culinary Arts? by EHL Insights](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/culinary-arts#:~:text=So%2C%20put%20simply%2C%20culinary%20arts,professions%20that%20involve%20food%20service). So, this is the source where I learned about Culinary Arts like the responsibilities of all the senses to have satisfaction with what's prepared as food. I also put in my notes the software like how this source which is from another site called "EHL Insights" had no ad pop-ups, it's easy to navigate and that it can be used on any electronic device with a screen. The next search I had was "What Is Culinary Arts?", and I of course went to the first result which was, [What Are The Culinary Arts?](https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/culinary-arts/what-are-the-culinary-arts/). This is from one of those school websites which are mostly reliable. This school website was called "Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts". I also said this has the same features as the last website. This also taught me things that I had never thoguht of. Like I didn't know Baking & Pastry Arts are different from Culinary Arts.

### Hardware
On to the hardware parts of the sources. So I wrote on my notes that my former Google search was Culinary Hardware because that only showed me physical hardware, so my next search was "Digital Culinary hardware". I didn't go to the first website this time. Instead, I went to this reliable website called [Epicurious.com](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/the-best-tablets-for-the-kitchen-article). This website talked about what tablets are the best for Kitchen uses in online recipes. According to the website, Apple iPads are the best kitchen tablets overall. My 2nd Google Search was "Culinary Electronic Gadgets". During page 1 of Google, I found another reliable source called [Culinary Hill](https://www.culinaryhill.com/cool-kitchen-gadgets/). This talks about 49 cool kitchen gadgets and I gotta say, they really mean what they say in the title. I was skimming through these cool gadgets until I found some that were electrical like this [Milk Frother](https://www.culinaryhill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.-MasterChef-Battery-Operated-Milk-Frother.jpg). This may look non electrical, but this milk frother is actually powered by batteries. Most of the gadget's power sources on this website are either batteries or plugs.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
My Engineering Design Process was **Research** because I was researching both the Culinary Software and Hardware. I did two searches for each Culinary `-ware` I'm almost done with this part of the process, so soon I will be on the next part of the EDP which is Brainstorming.

## Skills
So I used to have only one skill, but now I have two. So I will go through those skills more detailed.

### How To Google
Now "How To Google" was the only skill I had in entry 1, but I didn't add as much detail, so here I go. When I gooogled the sources for Culinary Software, I looked at the first website that was there and luckily, they were both reliable. However, when I googled the sources of Culinary Hardware, I looked through the rest of the websites in page 1 of Google rather than the first websites. Sometimes when I put the Google Search I go to the website that has the big boxed answers.

### Organization
So organization is my 2nd and new skill that I have achieved. I have used this skill on my Freedom Project Notes with bullet points. Bullet points to me are a very helpful tool for organizing ideas as well as the `<hr>` tag. So how I have organized my notes had bullet points that each represent something. 
1. First unindented Bullet Points represent my Google Searches
2. First indented Bullet Points represent the link to the website I found from my Google Searches
3. Second indented Bullet Points represent the features and notes from the websites that I found from my Google Searches.

This organization method of mine applies to both the Software and Hardware part of Culinary Arts.

## Conclusion
These were the only things I had, but when we get to entry 3, I'll have more info and skills on my Culinary Arts. Thank you for reading this 2nd entry. I hope you understand the process of evolving our entries. From getting one skill to 2 skills and moving to a new part of the Engineering Design Process. Until next time, bye!
